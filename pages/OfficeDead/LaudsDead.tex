\section{Lauds of the Dead}\label{laudsdead}
\fancyhead[RO,LE]{\textit{Lauds}}
\begin{secrubric}
    %The Monastic Diurnal is ambiguous on this rubric, but the Diurnale is clear.
    Before Lauds---if it be said separately from Matins---the Lord's Prayer and Angelic Salutation are said secretly. Otherwise, the Office begins at once with the Antiphon.
