\lett{O}{God,} whose nature and property is ever to have mercy and to forgive: receive our humble petitions; and though we and all thy servants be bound with the chain of our sins, yet let the pitifulness of thy great mercy loose us.

\lett{W}{e} beseech thee, O Lord, mercifully to hear the prayers of thy humble servants, and to forgive the sins of them that confess the same unto thee: that they may obtain of thy loving-kindness pardon and peace.

\lett{G}{raciously} shew forth upon us, O Lord, thy unspeakable mercy: that thou wouldest both loose us from all our sins, and likewise deliver us from the punishment which for the same we deserve.

\lett{O}{God,} who art wroth with them that sin against thee, and sparest them that are penitent: mercifully look upon the prayers of thy people who call upon thee; and turn away the scourges of thy wrath, which for our sins we justly deserve.

\lett{O}{God,} from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works do proceed: give unto thy servants that peace which the world cannot give; that both our hearts may be set to obey thy commandments, and also, that by thee we being defended from the fear of our enemies may pass our time in rest and quietness.

\lett{K}{indle,} O Lord, with the fire of the Holy Spirit our reins and our hearts: that we may serve thee with a chaste body, and please thee with a clean heart.

\lett{O}{God,} the Creator and Redeemer of all the faithful, grant unto the souls of thy servants and handmaids the remission of all their sins: that through devout supplications they may obtain the pardon which they have alway desired.

\lett{P}{revent} us, O Lord, we beseech thee, in all our doings with thy most gracious favour, and further us with thy continual help: that all our prayer and work may be begun, continued, and ended in thee.

\lett{A}{lmighty} and everlasting God, who hast dominion both of the living and of the dead, and hast mercy upon all whom thou foreknowest will be thine in faith and works: we humbly beseech thee; that all those for whom we are minded to pour forth our prayers, whether in this present world they still be held in the flesh, or being delivered from the body have passed into that which is to come, may at the intercession of all thy Saints obtain of thy bountiful goodness the remission of all their sins. Through Jesus Christ thy Son, our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, throughout all ages, world without end.
